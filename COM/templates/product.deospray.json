Many women do not know that we have the same sweat glands in the vulva as we do in the armpits.  It is normal for armpits to have a smell, similarly, the vulvar area can also smell. Sweat glands empty into hair follicles, so odor can be experienced anywhere where there is hair. From our clinical experience, many women that are worried about odor tend to wash their intimate parts excessively, which is not good. This is why we developed our gentle, pH-balanced intimate deodorant, or DeoSpray, which works just like an underarm deodorant, but for the sensitive intimate skin.\"<\/em><br\/><br\/><strong>-Dr. Gunvor Ekman-Ordeberg, OB\/GYN, MD.,PhD. <\/strong><\/p>","text_size":"typeset2","secondary_color":false}},"1658133913405b7b25-2":{"type":"button","disabled":true,"settings":{"button_label":"Button label","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false}}},"block_order":["1658133913405b7b25-0","1658133913405b7b25-1","1658133913405b7b25-2"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/IMG_7880.jpg","image_position":"center center","layout":"image_first","text_box_position":"middle","text_alignment":"left","image_ratio":"650px","full_width":false,"show_divider":false,"mobile_text_alignment":"left","mobile_image_ratio":"auto","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"multicolumn":{"type":"multicolumn","disabled":true,"blocks":{"column-0":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4.png","title":"","title_size":"h3","text":"","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false}},"column-1":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5.png","title":"","title_size":"h3","text":"","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false}},"column-2":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/6.png","title":"","title_size":"h3","text":"","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false}}},"block_order":["column-0","column-1","column-2"],"settings":{"heading":"How To Use","heading_size":"h2","image_ratio":"square","image_position":"top center","text_alignment":"left","show_divider":false,"mobile_text_alignment":"left","columns_mobile":"1","swipe_on_mobile":true,"padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"product-details":{"type":"product-details","disabled":true,"blocks":{"product-details-0":{"type":"description","disabled":true,"settings":{"heading":""}},"product-details-1":{"type":"collapsible_tab","settings":{"heading":"1.
