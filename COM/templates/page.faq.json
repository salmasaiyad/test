The same goes for the intimate\/groin area for both men and women, however this area is highly sensitive and cannot be treated with the same products formulated for the armpits. We created a safe and doctor-developed product for those that would like to use it. <\/p><p>As doctors, we have seen patients with sweat concerns that over wash or use incorrectly formulated products which can give them infections. It was our responsibility to give them a safe and effective solution to prevent them from unsafe habits. That is why we chose to develop an intimate deodorant that we as doctors can actually recommend.<\/p><p><\/p>"}},"e8182e39-9dd3-42b7-9dd2-e5058366385d":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Does the product contain any dangerous ingredients?","text":"<p>All of our products are approved by the Medical Products Agency and follow European Union guidelines for the manufacturing of cosmetic products.
