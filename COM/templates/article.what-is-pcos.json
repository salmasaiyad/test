The cause is yet unknown, but often there is a family history.<\/p><p> <br\/><strong>What causes PCOS?<br\/><\/strong>PCOS is caused by an imbalance in the hormones in your brain and your ovaries which result in extra production of testosterone (or male hormone) from your ovaries. Ovaries are enlarged with multiple cysts.<strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p><p> <br\/><strong>How is PCOS diagnosed?<br\/><\/strong>Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and examine you. If a diagnosis of PCOS is suspected, it can be confirmed with a blood test and ultrasound scan of your ovaries. Typically women with PCOS have lots of tiny cysts (like bubbles) in their ovaries. These are not harmful.<strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p><p> <br\/><strong>Why are the periods irregular?<br\/><\/strong>Having PCOS means that your ovaries are not getting the right hormonal signals from your pituitary gland. Without these signals you will not ovulate (make eggs). Your periods may be irregular or you may not have a period at all.<strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p><p> <br\/><strong>Why do I get acne and\/or extra hair on my body?<br\/><\/strong>Acne and extra hair on your face can happen if your body is making too much testosterone. All women make testosterone, but if you have PCOS, your ovaries make a little bit more testosterone than they are supposed to.<\/p><p> <br\/><strong>Will my PCOS affect my ability to have children some day?<br\/><\/strong>Women with PCOS have a normal uterus and healthy eggs but many women with PCOS have trouble getting pregnant. Some have no trouble at all though. If you have trouble conceiving, consult your doctor as there are many treatments which can help.<\/p><p> <br\/><strong>What can I do about having PCOS?<br\/><\/strong>While you can't cure PCOS, you can treat it. A healthy lifestyle is very important, including eating and daily exercise. There are also treatments which can help you manage irregular periods, hair growth and acne.<\/p>",
